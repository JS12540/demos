# Contributor Demos - README

Welcome to the Contributor Demos section of our `unifyai/demos` repository! This initiative is designed to foster collaboration and innovation within our community, allowing individuals and teams to contribute to a variety of exciting machine learning projects using ivy. Below, you will find detailed instructions on how to participate in these projects, ranging from plant disease recognition to sarcasm detection, and everything in between.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Fill Out the Contributor Form

Before diving into the code, we ask all interested participants to fill out a short form. This form captures essential information such as your name, email, and whether you plan to contribute individually or as part of a group. Please complete the form at this link: [Contributor Form](https://forms.gle/kTuRAmLh2SzKmm146).

### Step 2: Select a Project and Start Working

Once you've submitted the form, you're ready to start! Choose from one of the ten projects listed in our [Github Projects](https://github.com/orgs/unifyai/projects/18). Each project comes with a unique set of challenges and learning opportunities. If you decide to work as a group, ensure all members are aligned on the project choice.

### Step 3: Submitting Your Pull Request (PR)

After developing your solution, it's time to submit a Pull Request (PR) to the `unifyai/demos` repository. Make sure to link the specific issue you're addressing by including `closes <#issue no>.` in your PR description. This notation will help us track which PRs aim to solve which issues.

#### PR Description Guidelines

To streamline the review process and facilitate badge awarding, we require a uniform format for PR descriptions. Please include the GitHub IDs of all team members involved in the project at the end of your PR description, following this template:

```
# Team Members
- GitHubID1
- GitHubID2
- GitHubID3
- GitHubID4 (if applicable)
```

### Important Notes

- **Single PR Acceptance:** For each issue, only one PR will be merged. We encourage collaboration and communication within the community to combine efforts and submit the best possible solution.
- **Rising Contributors:** Contributors of the merged PR will be immediately promoted to [Rising Contributors](https://unify.ai/docs/ivy/overview/contributing/volunteer_program.html#rising-contributor). This status comes with recognition within our community and opportunities for further involvement in project development.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Ensure your code is well-documented and follows best practices for readability and maintainability.
- Be creative! We value innovation and unique approaches to solving problems.
- Stay engaged. Participate in discussions on your PR for feedback, suggestions, and improvements.
